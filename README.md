# ConfConnect.net

This project is intened to be an AWS Serverless stack that will allow Conference Attendees to _connect_ to gain _points_.
Conference Organisers can then use the points system as an incentive for attendees to mix, minge and network.

A Conference organiser will register their conference with a start and end date.
Attendees will then register by connection with a Social Media account and take a Selfie.

When an Attendee meets another participant at the conference, they can take a Selfie together.
Each attendee will be facially matched and notified of the connection.
